<h3>Welcome to the DDMoRe Model Description Language (MDL) Community page.</h3>

<div id="what-is-mdl" class="section level3">
<h3>What is MDL?</h3>
<p>MDL is a human writeable and human readable language designed to describe pharmacometric models. It is intended to be largely agnostic about the choice of target tool. MDL should facilitate clear and unambiguous definition of models, with information conveyed in a consistent manner to the PharmML representation and onwards to the target software specific code.</p>
