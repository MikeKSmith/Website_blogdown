<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The <strong>M</strong>odel <strong>D</strong>escription <strong>L</strong>anguage (MDL) and the
<strong>Pharm</strong>acometrics <strong>M</strong>arkup Language standard (PharmML<sup>[1])</sup> have been
developed to convey information about pharmacometrics models and tasks.
The goal of each language is to do this consistently between modellers
(using MDL) and between software target tools (using PharmML).</p>

<p>MDL is a human writeable and human readable language designed to
describe pharmacometric models. It is intended to be largely agnostic
about the choice of target tool. MDL should facilitate clear and
unambiguous definition of models, with information conveyed in a
consistent manner to the PharmML representation and onwards to the
target software specific code.</p>

<p>An important concept in the
MDL is the separation of data, parameter, model and task descriptions
into independent objects rather than combining these in a single file
(such as in NONMEM<sup>[2]).</sup> This supports reuse and interchange of the
objects which define each component of the model and related modelling
task. This independence means that model objects stored in the DDMoRe
Model Repository may be combined with user objects outside the
repository e.g. a Model Object, Parameter Object and a Task Properties
Object may be taken from the Repository and combined with user defined
Data Object. This may be useful when a user wishes to assess whether a
library model is predictive for their dataset, as a preliminary step
before further model refinement.</p>

<p>These facets (target software agnostic code + independence of MDL
objects) mean that model definition using MDL is more verbose than code
written specifically for any specific target tool. However the principle
concept of MDL is that model code is written once and used in many
different tools. For estimation, simulation, optimal design. So time
spent writing code initially is saved in the longer term since MDL
eliminates the need to recode models for different tasks and different
software tools.</p>

<h2>Why write a new language?</h2>

<p>A key deliverable of the DDMoRe project is a unified Model Description
Language (MDL), based on established principles, designed to be easily
read and written. It is designed to facilitate easy uptake by modellers
already experienced in other model definition languages, and will allow
the definition of any model-based analysis.</p>

<p>Several languages have been created to support M&amp;S activities. Examples
of widely used languages are NONMEM (NMTRAN), Monolix (MLXTRAN)<sup>[3],</sup>
BUGS<sup>[4]</sup> and MATLAB<sup>[5].</sup> However, none are shared, creating difficulties
for comparison and integration. Many tools have overlapping
functionality, and so the choice of one tool over another is driven
largely by user preference, availability of tools, experience of the
analyst and whether there is sufficient experience readily available to
the analyst to provide support and advice on model building techniques
specific for the tool in question. Considerable effort is currently
required when moving the model from one software tool to another, as
models always have to be recoded in the target software tool language,
by hand. A significant need exists to rectify this situation, which
DDMoRe is addressing.</p>

<p>Another common situation is using models which were developed by a third
party using software that we do not have available. In that case we must
try to re-encode the model before we can start using it or developing it
further. This can be difficult because we need to ensure that we have
all the information to construct the model in a different language. Do
we have all the necessary files, settings, subroutines, functions
available to us? Are the assumptions used in the model adequately
annotated or described in supporting documentation? Do we have
understanding of any tool-specific tricks and techniques that allow
the model to work in the original software?</p>

<p>MDL provides a user interface to describe models using a common language
standard. The aim is that the user writes the model (Model Object) once,
in MDL, then uses this model in the tools they require (and have
available) in order to complete their M&amp;S tasks, without any tool
specific recoding. This interoperability is a core deliverable of the
DDMoRe project.<sup>[6]</sup></p>

<p>Additionally, MDL is intended as a standard for communication of models.
An analyst who only uses one tool may wish to convey their model to a
third party. MDL provides the means to describe the model in a way that
is consistent and provides complete information about the model (without
any reference to target tool specific code). MDL is designed to focus on
describing WHAT the model conveys, rather than focussing on the HOW of
implementation. This has an impact on the structure and features used in
MDL, but it should aid clarity and reduce ambiguity.</p>

<h2>Integrated language standards</h2>

<p>As described above, MDL provides the user focused layer of model
description. This facilitates user understanding and model sharing
between analysts.</p>

<p>PharmML provides the software interchange standard within DDMoRe to
facilitate the transfer of models between target tools by ensuring that
all of the necessary information about the model is captured and can be
translated automatically to any given target tool that has an
appropriate PharmML converter.</p>

<p>ProbOnto<sup>[7]</sup> is an ontology and knowledge base that has been developed
to describe probability distributions in a consistent and unambiguous
way, as well as defining their functions, characteristics and the
relationships between distributions.</p>

<p>The Standard Output object (SO) standard provides a consistent format
for M &amp; S results and outputs. Its availability as an object within R
provides interchange and integration between existing R packages for M &amp;
S tasks within the DDMoRe infrastructure.</p>

<p>MDL, PharmML and the SO are the basis for interoperability which is one
of the core deliverables of the DDMoRe project.</p>

<h2>MDL in use</h2>

<p>Very few models can be retrieved from a repository or library, be fit to
any given set of data and pronounced valid for inference without further
assessment or changes. Thus, the process of fitting models to data,
assessing the fit through model diagnostics is an iterative process,
culminating in selecting the model which is parsimonious and fit for its
purpose in the inferential step decision making, making predictions
for future populations of interest, selecting dose or dosage regimen
etc. The combination of features in MDL and the ddmore R package
facilitates that process. MDLâ€™s structure makes changes to data, models,
parameters, tasks transparent making it clear exactly which elements
are changing and which are constant across steps. Using an R script to
define M &amp; S task workflow facilitates an unbroken workflow for a given
model and dataset, from exploratory analysis, estimation, diagnostics
and simulation across a variety of tools without having to recode the
model.</p>

<h2>MDL components and structure</h2>

<p>The MDL objects are typically defined in a file with extension .mdl.
Models may also be stored and retrieved from the DDMoRe Repository
either as MDL or PharmML. The key concept in MDL is that these objects
can be passed to any target software for use in modelling tasks:
estimation, model diagnostics and evaluation, simulation, optimal
design.</p>

<p>An overview of the currently specified MDL objects is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>#image2.png</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1 MDL Objects</strong></p>

<p>The MDL is used to specify the inputs and the model used in an M &amp; S
task. It does this with four MDL objects defining the model, parameters,
data and task properties. An additional object is used to specify the
group of objects required for a given task which is known as the
Modelling Objects Group (MOG).</p>

<p>The Model Object is the core element of the MDL and Modelling Objects
Group (MOG). It defines the mathematical and statistical properties of
the model by defining the structural, covariate, variability and
observation models. While other objects may change depending on task,
the Model Object will typically be unchanged for tasks associated with
that model e.g. data visualisation, parameter estimation, model
diagnostics, prediction, simulation or optimal design.</p>

<p>The Data Object describes the source of the data and the attributes of
each of the data variables. It allows the user to define the inputs to
the model and how these inputs and observed data are to be used in
definition of the model. It may also be used with data visualisation
tools without a Model Object.</p>

<p>The Design Object defines the design parameters interventions,
sampling schedules, covariate distributions, populations, study arms -
for optimal design or design evaluation, and also for simulation. The
Design Object replaces the Data Object in these cases.</p>

<p>The Parameter Object provides values for structural and variability
parameters, including bounds on the parameter values for use in
estimation. These can be fixed or initial values with associated
constraints for parameter estimation or an instantiation of model
parameters for use in making predictions or simulations.</p>

<p>The Prior Object defines prior distributions and values of the
parameters when performing Bayesian estimation of parameters. It
replaces the Parameter Object in this case.</p>

<p>The Task Properties Object contains settings specific to the task which
will be passed on to the target software e.g. when estimating parameters
it will define the estimation algorithm and associated settings for the
algorithm.</p>

<p>It is through combination of the Model Object with other objects that we
instantiate the model - linking inputs and observations from the Data or
Design Object, parameter values from the Parameter or Design Object and
information about the task settings in the Task Properties Object with
the Model Object to form a Modelling Objects Group (MOG) ready for
executing a modelling, simulation or optimal design task.</p>

<p>Objects are defined and stored in a MDL file with extension .mdl. It is
possible to define more than one Model, Data, Design, Parameter Prior
and Task Properties Object within a single MDL file. The MOG Object
defines specific individual objects within an MDL file for a given task.
Most commonly there will be one object of each type of information in a
MDL file used for a task.</p>

<h3>Independence of MDL objects</h3>

<p>Typically, existing software has used control files that bring the
elements in MDL (data, parameters, model and task definitions) together
in control, model or project file(s). What is new in the MDL is the
concept that the elements of the Modelling Object Group (data,
parameters, model, task properties) are distinct and independent,
allowing the user to combine new data and parameters applicable to their
situation with an existing model. Within a M&amp;S task workflow it is easy
to see how the core Model Object remains unchanged between estimating
parameters, performing model diagnostics, making predictions and
simulation future outcomes. The fact that the elements of the MDL are
exchangeable also makes it easier to see exactly what elements change
between these M &amp; S workflow steps.</p>

<p>Independence of objects also means that the Model Object should be
independent of the data and, as a consequence, more easy to read and
interpret without needing to have the data to hand. Having an
independent Task Properties Object means that the user may store their
preferred settings for tasks and target software, suitable for reuse
across models and modelling tasks, to facilitate comparison between
target software and to ensure reproducibility of results.</p>

<p>Independence of the MDL objects entails defining the contents of each
object in isolation. Variables from another MDL object must be declared
in the object in which they are referred to e.g. if we need to refer to
the Model Object <strong>OBSERVATION</strong> block variable Y in the Data Object
<strong>DATA_INPUT_VARIABLES</strong> block then we must declare a matching
variable Y in the Data Object.</p>

<h2>Task Execution with the ddmore R package</h2>

<p>To perform tasks with the model, the user will need to use the ddmore R
package. This package contains functions for executing commonly used
tasks on the MDL file. The R functions can read and parse MDL objects
from a MDL file to create R object representations of MDL, which can
then be manipulated within R. These representations of the MDL objects
can be combined to form a MOG and then written back to a new MDL file.
This means that an MDL file can contain the core Model Object and
associated Data, Design, Parameter, Prior and multiple Task Properties
Objects which can then be combined into MOGs ready to perform specific
tasks. This aids reproducibility since with one MDL file, data set and
associated R script the user can perform multiple steps in a
pharmacometric workflow for a given model.</p>

<p>Estimation using the estimate function takes as input the user specified
MDL file or a MOG object defined within R. Additional functions allow
the user to call modelling tools such as Perl speaks NONMEM (PsN)<sup>[8].</sup>
Each task produces a Standard Output (SO) object in R which may be the
final output or used in subsequent tasks using functions from the ddmore
R package or other R packages and commands.</p>

<p>Using R as the language for defining the workflow for M &amp; S tasks with
MDL objects allows analysts to tap into existing R packages for
performing those tasks. The ddmore package R functions are provided to
read and extract information from the SO object and to convert between
this,
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xpose4/index.html">Xpose</a><sup>[9],</sup>
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlxR/index.html">mlxR<sup>[10],</sup> PFIM<sup>[11]</sup> and PopED<sup>[12]</sup>
</a>R packages.
The ddmore R package will extend and enhance what the analyst can do
with existing R packages through the common standards that the DDMoRe
project brings.</p>

<p>Task properties and settings defined in the Task Properties Object of
MDL are distinct from arguments to the R functions for executing tasks.
The Task Properties Object provides information to the appropriate
target software about the particular settings and options required for a
given task. The R function arguments are command line settings or
options which are employed when invoking the target software. The Task
Properties Object may define the estimation algorithm and associated
settings for NONMEM, but the command line options for PsN provided from
the ddmore functions govern how NONMEM should be called by PsN. For
example, Task Properties specifies an ESTIMATION block with estimation
method set to FOCEI, while the arguments of the bootstrap.PsN function
in R allow the user to set bootstrap options from PsN such as threads,
stratify_on etc. (See <a href="http://psn.sourceforge.net/pdfdocs/bootstrap_userguide.pdf">PsN bootstrap
documentation</a>
for more details on PsN bootstrap options).</p>

<h2><strong>The MDL Integrated Development Environment</strong></h2>

<p>The MDL Integrated Development Environment (MDL-IDE) is a software
platform for writing models with MDL. The MDL editor within the MDL-IDE
implements the rules of the language through recognising MDL
constructs and having a defined grammar and it ensures that MDL models
are syntactically correct and result in valid PharmML. The MDL-IDE also
provides additional tools giving access to an R editor and console â€“
so that the user can not only develop models, but execute tasks with
them and define task workflow through R scripts.</p>

<p>The MDL-IDE gives warnings when the user writes MDL that will result in
valid PharmML, but where MDL constructs are used that may not be
interoperable. It gives errors when the user writes code that breaks MDL
grammar rules and that will result in invalid PharmML.</p>

<h2><strong>On interoperability</strong></h2>

<p>A key goal of the DDMoRe project is to have an intoperability framework
in which models are written in a consistent language, translated to
PharmML and from there converted to target software code. Before the
DDMoRe project no existing language standard existed across target
software used in pharmacometrics modelling, and while the underlying
models could be expressed consistently in mathematical and statistical
terms, the implementation of any given model varied by tool and by user
according to their experience with a given target software tool.</p>

<p>There is <strong><em>some</em></strong> flexibility within MDL around how the user can
express the mathematical and statistical models. Having flexibility
allows the user to encode models quickly in a common language (MDL)
which can then be shared with others and mutually understood. This
flexibility also facilitates encoding in a given target when that
language construct does not have a parallel in other tools. <strong>However</strong>,
we <strong>STRONGLY</strong> encourage the user to encode the majority of models in a
way that will facilitate interoperability. There are MDL constructs that
facilitate interoperability these generally appear as built-in
functions which translate to specific constructs in PharmML and the
target software. These constructs cover many typical models and are
designed to allow the user to generate code quickly and have high
confidence that it will be interoperable across tools.</p>

<p>The Model Description Language Interactive Development Environment
(MDL-IDE) should assist the user in ensuring that the models encoded are
valid MDL (and as a consequence, also valid PharmML). Not all models
will result in code which can be readily converted to all target tools.</p>

<p>These interoperability constructs will be highlighted in the subsequent
sections, but users should pay particular attention to sections on the
use of <strong>GROUP_VARIABLES,</strong> <strong>INDIVIDUAL_VARIABLES</strong> and the
<strong>MODEL_PREDICTION</strong>.</p>

<h2>Evolution of MDL</h2>

<p>Development of MDL has been led and influenced by domain experts in M &amp;
S, computer language development, system interchange language
development (markup languages), and developers of software systems. In
developing MDL we have looked at features in established M&amp;S languages,
as mentioned above, and aimed to pick out features that will facilitate
interoperability, while retaining the flexibility in these languages to
describe complex models. The current MDL implementation focusses on
interoperability in order to demonstrate that capability. The language
standards in MDL, PharmML and SO are the key to eliminating the recoding
necessary to pass models between tools used for different M&amp;S tasks.</p>

<p>The MDL language attempts to balance consistency and clarity in
definitions, with interoperability and flexibility in translation to
PharmML and on to target software. It will continue to evolve to
incorporate new features, extending the range of models that can be
expressed using the language.</p>

<p>Trying to define a language that maps to all possible models as defined
in all possible tools is virtually impossible. However, having a
well-defined software interchange standard (PharmML) and mapping MDL
into PharmML allows us to focus on describing model features with one
target in mind PharmML. The two languages MDL and PharmML - have
evolved during the course of the project. The aim is that these two
languages should go hand in hand that MDL should convey in an
accessible, user (analyst) friendly way, the models that can be encoded
in PharmML.</p>

<p>Converter tools then interpret the PharmML rather than the MDL for each
software target. Testing this conversion and comparing output downstream
allows us to check that the translation results in comparable models.</p>

<p>Future pharmacometrics tools could provide converters to import and
export PharmML or use MDL directly as the model specification language.
It is our hope that the DDMoRe standards would facilitate more
consistency, better understanding of models as well as interoperability
between modelling and simulation tools in the future.</p>
